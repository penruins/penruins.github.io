    中国大学生基本上没在教育上获得任何批判性思维或者学术能力上的提高。徒劳地卷一些毫无价值，陈旧落后的课程，差不多是服了四年学役。任何有意义的知识和经验都需要在培养计划之外获得。<br>
    <i>Compared with the United States, students in China, India and Russia do not gain critical thinking skills over
        four years. Furthermore, while students in India and Russia gain academic skills during the first two years,
        students in China do not.</i>

    马克思认为，资本只有不停地榨取劳动力，才能获得发展。在马克思的分析中，资本家为了追求利润的最大化，会刻意压低劳动者的工资，使工资保持在一个仅能维持劳动者（及其家庭）生存、并使人口得以增长的较低水准。新增的劳动人口为资本的再生产提供了源源不断的剥削对象。由于资本家之间的激烈竞争，竞争力较弱的中小企业逐渐失势，被强势的企业吞并或击垮。这导致小资产阶级逐渐沦为无产阶级。资产阶级在人口中的比例逐渐下降，而无产阶级的比例则相应上升。这导致社会最终被割裂为两个利益直接对立的阶级。<br>
    <i>Marx believed that capital can develop only if it constantly squeezes labor. In Marx's analysis, in order to
        maximize profits, capitalists will deliberately lower the wages of laborers, keeping wages at a low level that
        can only sustain the survival of laborers (and their families) and enable population growth. The newly-increased
        working population provides a steady stream of exploitation targets for the reproduction of capital. Due to
        fierce competition among capitalists, small and medium-sized enterprises with weaker competitiveness gradually
        lose their position and are annexed or destroyed by powerful enterprises. This caused the petty bourgeoisie to
        gradually degenerate into the proletariat. The proportion of the bourgeoisie in the population gradually
        declined, while the proportion of the proletariat rose correspondingly. This led to the eventual fragmentation
        of society into two classes with directly opposed interests.</i><br>

<div>24 上善若水，水善利万物而不争。处众人之所恶，故几于道。居善地，心善渊，与善仁，言善信，正善治，事善能，动善时。夫唯不争，故无尤<br>

    <i>The best way to do good is like water, which moistens everything but never fights with it. He is willing to be in
        the lowly place that people hate, so it is close to the Tao. To live, we should be as humble as water. We should
        be as deep-seated as water. We should treat people as water. We should be as intimate as water. We should talk
        as water. We should be as honest as water. We should be good at governance. We should be as omnipotent as water.
        We should act as water and seize the opportunity. It is precisely because he does not contend with things that
        he has no fault.</i><br>
    -- 《道德经》 "Tao Te Ching"
