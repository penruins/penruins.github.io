    A compiler is a computer program which helps you transform source code written in a high-level language
    into low-level machine language. It translates the code written in one programming language to some other
    language without changing the meaning of the code. The compiler also makes the end code efficient,
    which is optimized for execution time and memory space.

    The compiling process includes basic translation mechanisms and error detection.
    The compiler process goes through lexical, syntax, and semantic analysis at the front end and code
    generation and optimization at the back-end.
